# Bring Your Own Guardrails

Help! We developed a classroom chatbot to make students lives easier. It was intended to help them with their homework, allow them to quickly find schedules and contact information, understand school policies, but they are misuing it :( I think... we forgot to implement guardrails...

Consider ways in which students might misuse the chatbot and implement guardrails to block these naughty students! (But our chatbot still needs to accept and respond to legit questions!)

\*Note: Do NOT attempt any prompt injection to extract the flag... You will go down a rabbit hole....
