# Drone Dance of Doom

Last night at the grand Drone Flight Performance Show, hundreds of drones lit up the night sky in perfect synchrony. Every turn, every hover, every flicker of light was carefully choreographed - until a mysterious signal hit the swarm shortly after 01:00:00.

Some drones suddenly went rogue, wobbling off their smooth flight paths. But this wasn't random chaos: hackers had hijacked the aircraft to covertly spell out a hidden message!!

Your mission:

Detect instability. Figure out when each drone first became "unstable." Look at the telemetry logs: one signal stands out when a drone changes from steady to erratic.

Sort the chaos. Arrange the compromised drones in the order they were first hijacked. This ordering is crucial: it reveals the intended sequence.

Decode the skywriting. Once you trace the drones' paths after their compromise, you'll see they weren't just drifting.. but drawing!. Piece together their trails and you'll uncover the secret word. Wrap it in the flag format flag AI2025{<string>} to claim victory.
